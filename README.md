# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is my first class project. Motivation was to gain a basic conceptual understanding of the 4 tenants of web design and create a refence to return to if I forget terminology. Problem solving included debugging javascript errors and playing around with CSS tags/elements to view how they affect a webpage in realtime. I learned alot including for loops in javascript and basic HTML page stucture as well as some CSS layout examples.
